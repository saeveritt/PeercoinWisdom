# peercoinwisdom

The aim and scope of Peercoinwisdom.com (PPCW) focuses on increasing public exposure of community driven projects and technical 
articles pertaining to Peercoin itself. In order to expand dialog between community developers, researchers and the public, 
PPCW will become a resource of technical information for the crypto-community to familiarize itself with.

The main focal point for this project is set towards the Peer Review section. In this section will reside articles pertaining but 
not limited to technical project proposals, comprehensive financial analysis and tutorials, market simulations utilizing 
blockchain data, declarations of new DAOs, DACs, assets and more. Anyone willing to can submit text to be peer reviewed publicly 
and if well received by the community will subsequently be published to the PPCW Journal. It is in this journal where work in less 
narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields may be discovered among its contemporaries. The academic quality of publicly 
available information is priority but by no means prevents the publication of invalid research. In this regard, community 
researchers and developers wishing to be apart of the publishing process will be provided Publishing Keys to help ensure quality 
articles are chosen.

Future and potential resources provided by PPCW consist of but are not limited to a block explorer, PA (PeerAssets) 
web client, and financial market data accompanied with charts covering multiple exchanges. An initial outline of the website 
can be found at the following address http://www.peercoinwisdom.com

community wishing to be involved.
